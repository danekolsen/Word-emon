Word-emon

Another iPhone app built for an API hackathon.

I decided to work with the Oxford Dictionary API, and created an app that would allow the user to capture, get definitions for and translations of any english word they found. I also incorporated machine learning to allow the user to capture words using the camera, or pass in an image, and then select from any of the words found in the image to be passed to the API for a definition. The app will also read the word aloud to help the user with pronunciation. Captured words are stored for future access to reinforce learning and memorization.

The style, title, and theme are a rip off of the Pokemon game franchise.

Key features:
  -API calls to Oxford Dictionary for definitions & translations
  -Machine Learning/Image Processing
  -Text to Speech
